# build-clj

Common [`tools.build`](https://github.com/clojure/tools.build) tasks abstracted into a library, building on the examples in the [official `tools.build` guide](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build).

Having implemented `build.clj` (using `tools.build`) in several of my open source projects
I found there was a lot of repetition across them, so I factored out
the common functionality into this library.

**Caution: this wrapper has outgrown its original goal (of being a simple wrapper to eliminate boilerplate) and has far more knobs and dials than I intended, so I would strongly advise you learn to use raw `tools.build` instead for anything beyond the simplest build script needs!**

## Use with `build.clj`

Since it depends on both `tools.build` and
[Erik Assum's `deps-deploy`](https://github.com/slipset/deps-deploy),
your `:build` alias can just be:

```clojure
  :build {:deps {io.github.seancorfield/build-clj
                 {:git/tag "v0.9.0" :git/sha "d758807"}}
          :ns-default build}
```

Your `build.clj` can start off as follows:

```clojure
(ns build
  (:require [clojure.tools.build.api :as b]
            [org.corfield.build :as bb]))

(def lib 'myname/mylib)
;; if you want a version of MAJOR.MINOR.COMMITS:
(def version (format "1.0.%s" (b/git-count-revs nil)))
```

If you don't want `deps-deploy` -- perhaps your project is only building uberjars
or you have some other deployment process for your JAR files (or perhaps you are
not building JAR files at all) -- then you can specify a "slim" entry point to
`build-clj` that does not include that dependency:

```clojure
  :build {:deps {io.github.seancorfield/build-clj
                 {:git/tag "v0.9.0" :git/sha "d758807"
                  ;; omits deps-deploy dependency:
                  :deps/root "slim"}}
          :ns-default build}
```

## Standalone CLI Usage

While `build-clj` is intended primarily for use with a `build.clj` file, you
can use it directly from the CLI without a `build.clj` file for many common
operations.

Assuming you have a `:build` alias as above (with or without `:ns-default`),
you could run commands like this:

```
# run the tests using default options:
clojure -T:build org.corfield.build/run-tests
# clean the target folder:
clojure -T:build org.corfield.build/clean
# build a library JAR:
clojure -T:build org.corfield.build/jar :lib myname/mylib :version '"1.0.123"'
# deploy that library to Clojars:
clojure -T:build org.corfield.build/deploy :lib myname/mylib :version '"1.0.123"'
# build an application uberjar:
clojure -T:build org.corfield.build/uber :lib myname/myapp :main my.app.core
```

## Tasks Provided

The following common build tasks are provided, all taking an options
hash map as the single argument _and returning that hash map unchanged_
so you can reliably thread the build tasks.
_[Several functions in `clojure.tools.build.api` return `nil` instead]_

* `clean`     -- clean the target directory (wraps `delete` from `tools.build`),
* `deploy`    -- deploy to Clojars (wraps `deploy` from `deps-deploy`),
* `install`   -- install the JAR locally (wraps `create-basis` and `install` from `tools.build`),
* `jar`       -- build the (library) JAR and `pom.xml` files (wraps `create-basis`, `write-pom`, `copy-dir`, and `jar` from `tools.build`),
* `uber`      -- build the (application) uber JAR, with optional `pom.xml` file creation and/or AOT compilation (wraps `create-basis`, `write-pom`, `copy-dir`, `compile-clj`, and `uber` from `tools.build`),
* `run-tests` -- run the project's tests (wraps `create-basis`, `java-command`, and `process` from `tools.build`, to run the `:main-opts` in your `:test` alias).

For `deploy`, `install`, and `jar`, you must provide at least `:lib` and `:version`.
For `uber`, you must provide at least `:lib` or `:uber-file` for the name of the JAR file.
Everything else has "sane" defaults, but can be overridden.

> Note: you can always get help for a `build.clj` file by running `clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc` which uses the `help/doc` function from the built-in `:deps` alias in the root `deps.edn` file.

## Typical `build.clj` with `build-clj`

You might typically have the following tasks in your `build.clj`:

```clojure
(defn ci "Run the CI pipeline of tests (and build the JAR)." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :version version)
      (bb/run-tests)
      (bb/clean)
      (bb/jar)))

(defn install "Install the JAR locally." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :version version)
      (bb/install)))

(defn deploy "Deploy the JAR to Clojars." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :version version)
      (bb/deploy)))
```

Or if you are working with an application, you might have:

```clojure
(defn ci "Run the CI pipeline of tests (and build the uberjar)." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :main main)
      (bb/run-tests)
      (bb/clean)
      (bb/uber)))
```

> Note: this `uber` task in `build-clj` supplies the [log4j2 conflict handler](https://github.com/seancorfield/build-uber-log4j2-handler) to the underlying `uber` task of `tools.build` so that you don't have to worry about the plugins cache files being merged.

### `pom.xml` and `jar`

By default, the `jar` task calls `tools.build`'s `write-pom` function and
will write `pom.xml` into `target/classes/META-INF/maven/<group>/<artifact>/pom.xml`.
You can provide a template for that file, that contains information that
`write-pom` does not provide (and does not offer options to override), such
as `<description>` and `<licenses>`. Whilst that file _could_ be called
`pom.xml` and would get picked up automatically by `write-pom` as the source POM,
that would leave you with a potentially incomplete and/or outdated file.
Instead, consider using `template/pom.xml` or something similar, and
specify `:src-pom "template/pom.xml"` as an additional option to `build-clj`'s
`jar` task:

```clojure
(defn ci "Run the CI pipeline of tests (and build the JAR)." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :version version :src-pom "template/pom.xml")
      (bb/run-tests)
      (bb/clean)
      (bb/jar)))
```

`template/pom.xml` is suggested rather than, say `pom_template.xml` at the
root, so that GitHub Actions' `setup_java` still find it and recognizes the
repo as being Maven-based for caching purposes (it looks for `**/pom.xml`).

## Running Tests

If you want a `run-tests` task in your `build.clj`, independent of the `ci`
task shown above, the following can be added:

```clojure
(defn run-tests "Run the tests." [opts]
  (-> opts (bb/run-tests)))
```

By default, the `run-tests` task will run whatever is in your `:test` alias
but if there is no `:main-opts`, it assumes Cognitect's `test-runner`:

```clojure
  :test
  {:extra-paths ["test"]
   :extra-deps {org.clojure/test.check {:mvn/version "1.1.1"}
                io.github.cognitect-labs/test-runner
                {:git/tag "v0.5.0" :git/sha "48c3c67"}}
   :exec-fn cognitect.test-runner.api/test}
```

The above alias allows for tests to be run directly via:

```bash
clojure -X:test
```

The `run-tests` task above would run the tests as if the `:test` alias
also contained:

```clojure
   :main-opts ["-m" "cognitect.test-runner"]
```

If you want to use a different test runner with `build-clj`, just provide
different dependencies and supply `:main-opts`:

```clojure
  ;; a :test alias that specifies the kaocha runner:
  :test
  {:extra-paths ["test"]
   :extra-deps {lambdaisland/kaocha {:mvn/version "1.0.887"}}
   :main-opts ["-m" "kaocha.runner"]}
```

With this `:test` alias, the `run-tests` task above would run your tests using Kaocha.

## Running Additional Programs

In addition, there is a `run-task` function that takes an options hash
map and a vector of aliases. This runs an arbitrary Clojure main function,
determined by those aliases, in a subprocess. `run-tests` uses this by
adding a `:test` alias and in the absence of any `:main-opts` behind those
aliases, assumes it should run `cognitect.test-runner`'s `-main` function.

`run-task` picks up `:jvm-opts` and `:main-opts` from the specified aliases
and uses them as the `:java-args` and `:main-args` respectively in a call to
`clojure.tools.build.api/java-command` to build the `java` command to run.
By default, it runs `clojure.main`'s `-main` function with the specified
`:main-args`.

For example, if your `deps.edn` contains the following alias:

```clojure
  :eastwood {:extra-deps {jonase/eastwood {:mvn/version "0.5.1"}}
             :main-opts ["-m" "eastwood.lint" "{:source-paths,[\"src\"]}"]}
```

Then you can define an `eastwood` task in your `build.clj` file:

```clojure
(defn eastwood "Run Eastwood." [opts]
  (-> opts (bb/run-task [:eastwood])))
```

Or you could just make it part of your `ci` pipeline without adding that function:

```clojure
(defn ci "Run the CI pipeline of tests (and build the JAR)." [opts]
  (-> opts
      (assoc :lib lib :version version)
      (bb/run-task [:eastwood])
      (bb/run-tests)
      (bb/clean)
      (bb/jar)))
```

## Defaults

The following defaults are provided:

* `:target`    -- `"target"`,
* `:basis`     -- `(b/create-basis {})` -- this is a reproducible basis, i.e., it ignores the user `deps.edn` file -- if you want your user `deps.edn` included, you will need to explicitly pass `:basis (b/create-basis {:user :standard})` into tasks,
* `:class-dir` -- `(str target "/classes")`,
* `:jar-file`  -- `(format \"%s/%s-%s.jar\" target lib version)`,
* `:uber-file` -- `(format \"%s/%s-%s.jar\" target lib version)` if `:version` is provided, else `(format \"%s/%s-standalone.jar\" target lib)`.

As of v0.5.0, the four functions that compute those defaults are exposed for use in your own `build.clj` files:
* `(default-target)`    -- return the default for `:target`,
* `(default-basis)`     -- return the default for `:basis`,
* `(default-class-dir)` -- return the default for `:class-dir`; `(default-class-dir target)` is also available,
* `(default-jar-file lib version)` -- return the default for `:jar-file` or `:uber-file`; `(default-jar-file target lib version)` and `(default-jar-file version)` are also available (the latter defaults `:lib` to `'application`).

For the functions defined in `org.corfield.build`, you can override
the high-level defaults as follows:

* `clean`
  * `:target`,
* `deploy`
  * Requires: `:lib` and `:version`,
  * `:target`, `:class-dir`, `:jar-file`,
* `install`
  * Requires: `:lib` and `:version`,
  * `:target`, `:class-dir`, `:basis`, `:jar-file`,
* `jar`
  * Requires: `:lib` and `:version`,
  * `:target`, `:class-dir`, `:basis`, `:resource-dirs`, `:scm`, `:src-dirs`, `:tag` (defaults to `(str "v" version)`), `:jar-file`,
* `uber`
  * Requires: `:lib` or `:uber-file`,
  * `:target`, `:class-dir`, `:basis`, `:compile-opts`, `:main`, `:ns-compile`, `:resource-dirs`, `:scm`, `:src-dirs`, `:tag` (defaults to `(str "v" version)` if `:version` provided), `:version`
* `run-tests`
  * `:aliases` -- for any additional aliases beyond `:test` which is always added,
  * Also accepts any options that `run-task` accepts.

See the docstrings of those task functions for more detail on which options
they can also accept and which additional defaults they offer.

As noted above, `run-task` takes an options hash map and a vector of aliases.
The following options can be provided to `run-task` to override the default
behavior:

* `:java-opts` -- used _instead of_ `:jvm-opts` from the aliases,
* `:jvm-opts`  -- used _in addition to_ the `:java-opts` vector or _in addition to_ `:jvm-opts` from the aliases,
* `:main`      -- used _instead of_ `'clojure.main` when building the `java` command to run,
* `:main-args` -- used _instead of_ `:main-opts` from the aliases,
* `:main-opts` -- used _in addition to_ the `:main-args` vector or _in addition to_ `:main-opts` from the aliases.

> Note: if `:main-args` is not provided and there are no `:main-opts` in the aliases provided, the default will be `["-m" "cognitect.test-runner"]` to ensure that `run-tests` works by default without needing `:main-opts` in the `:test` alias (since it is common to want to start a REPL with `clj -A:test`).

## Monorepos and Library JARs

If you are working in a monorepo, such as the [Polylith architecture](https://polylith.gitbook.io/), and need
to build library JAR files from projects that rely on `:local/root` dependencies to specify other source
components, you will generally want to pass `:transitive true` to the `jar` task.

Without `:transitive true`, i.e., by default, the `jar` task generates a `pom.xml` from just the dependencies
specified directly in the project `deps.edn` and does not consider dependencies from local source subprojects.
In addition, by default `jar` only copies `src` and `resources` from the current project folder.

With `:transitive true`, the `jar` task includes direct dependencies from local source subprojects when
generating the `pom.xml` and will also copy all folders found on the classpath -- which is generally all
of the `src` and `resources` folders from those local source subprojects.

> Note: git dependencies look like local source subprojects so they will also be included if you specify `:transitive true` -- but your `pom.xml` will not contain those dependencies anyway so users of your library JAR would have a time if git folders are not copied into the JAR!

## Projects Using `build-clj`

You can see how `build-clj` is used to reduce boilerplate in the
`build.clj` file of the following projects:

* [`expectations`](https://github.com/clojure-expectations/clojure-test/blob/develop/build.clj)
* [`honeysql`](https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql/blob/develop/build.clj)
* [`next.jdbc`](https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc/blob/develop/build.clj)
